userspace tiny kernel. This is inspired by a book, "Professional Embbedded Software Development" by hzliyun.
You can get more info by visiting the author's blog (http://blog.csdn.net/hzliyun/).

There is a ClearRTOS written by hzliyun which runs on userspace. I hope I can rewrite another kernel as I go
through the book.
